## Word Builder
This repo generates words for you.

# Requirements
* Maven
* MongoDB

# Setup
Just set the word size at runner and then it will combine the alphabet letter generating all possible words with those letters at that size. The amount of words generated is huge depending on the size set up, that's why we are using MongoDB in the process.
